# Task 2 â€“ Business Card Design | Oasis Infobyte Internship

As part of my Oasis Infobyte internship, I was challenged to create a standout business card that reflects strong visual hierarchy and professional polish.

This design features a smooth gradient blend of **#2f4756 â†’ #567c8d**, bringing a calm yet confident energy to the layout. Thoughtfully chosen typography brings balance and structure, giving each text element a distinct voice on the card.

### ðŸŽ¨ Design Elements:
- **Gradient**: Deep navy to soft teal (#2f4756 â†’ #567c8d)
- **Layout**: Clean, minimal, and visually aligned
- **Typography System**:
  - **H1**: 162px â€“ *Playfair Display* (Elegant and bold)
  - **H2**: 40px â€“ *Playfair Display*
  - **Subheading**: 16px â€“ *Canva Sans* (Modern and crisp)
  - **Body**: 12px â€“ *Arial* (Simple and readable)

### ðŸŒ± What I Gained:
This task helped sharpen my eye for visual hierarchy, contrast, and the role of typography in branding. A simple card â€” but a meaningful step in my growth as a UI/UX designer.
